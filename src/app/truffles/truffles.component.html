  <h2>Gourmet Truffles</h2>
  <p>At Ganache Chocolatier, truffles are really our specialty.
    It is what inspired the name of our shop!
    Each truffle has a center of ganache, a mixture of chocolate and cream, with a carefully decorated outer shell that indicates each flavor.
    We offer 13 different regular truffles, 6 liqueur truffles, 12 mini truffles, and 2 mini liqueur truffles.
    We even offer a small selectional of seasonal truffles.
    Click on our Truffle ID Card for more information on each of the truffles.</p>
